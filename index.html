          <h2>Introduction: Affordable Housing Crisis</h2>

          <p class="lead">
     Through working with our community partners, the Center for Leadership and Justice, we have learned about the difficulties and intricacies of buying a home in this decade, where it has become increasingly challenging. Many factors, such as income, job stability, and credit score, disadvantage families.
The Center for Leadership and Justice created the Urban Suburban Affordables (USA Housing), a program that has purchased land underneath more than 200 homes in the Greater Hartford area. This initiative helps hundreds of low-income families purchase homes. Our collaboration with our community partners has allowed us to analyze their data for the 212 homes.The community land trust (CLT) allows homeownership to be more affordable to buyers by separating ownership of the land and the home. The organization owns the land, while homeowners purchase the house at a reduced price. USA Homes also supports homeowners, reducing foreclosure risks and stabilizing neighborhoods against displacement.
  The question is: how has the housing market impacted the USA homes' sale rate and price changes in the suburbs of Hartford? In this heavily fluctuating economy, the stability of a mortgage can be tough for families to maintain. By researching 20 houses in the suburbs of Windsor and Bloomfield, CT, we chose to chart and map 10 from each town that have been sold multiple times, starting from when the organization started in 1995. To conceal the addresses of the homes in Windsor and Bloomfield, we used the letters "B" and "WN," along with a number that directly correlates to an address.
  By using Zillow and the town property assessor to obtain the estimated values of the homes that have been sold, we can share knowledge and data with our community partners to help them better understand how the fluctuating economy has impacted their homes. Each sale also indicates two to four different homeowners and the data will show how the value of each home has negatively or positively impacted the organization. It is essential to compare the prices and dates of sales of the USA homes to national data to see how trends in the Greater Hartford area coincide.
  Our analysis shows that despite the fluctuating economy, the USA Homes program has provided stability for low-income families in Greater Hartford, even as national and local market trends have experienced challenges. We find that while the program reduces some market inequities and improves homeowner stability, it also highlights ongoing struggles tied to home affordability and rapidly increasing prices. These findings can guide future strategies to strengthen our community partners' housing initiatives.

          <p> Figure 1:In a direct contrast to Windsor, the market seems to fluctuate dramatically in Bloomfield, as shown in the ten chosen properties - with some increasing drastically, some increasing minimally, and one even decreasing in value. The market in Bloomfield appears to fluctuate a lot more than Windsor, and therefore makes it much less predictable.

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future Trinity College students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, like this example from <a href='https://data.ct.gov'>CT Open Data</a>. Also link to your shared Google Sheets when appropriate.</p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>
