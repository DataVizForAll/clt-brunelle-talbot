          <h2>Introduction: Affordable Housing Crisis</h2>

          <p class="lead">
     Through working with our community partners, the Center for Leadership and Justice, we have learned about the difficulties and intricacies of buying a home in this decade, where it has become increasingly challenging. Many factors, such as income, job stability, and credit score, disadvantage families.
  The Center for Leadership and Justice created the Urban Suburban Affordables (USA Housing), a program that has purchased land underneath more than 200 homes in the Greater Hartford area. This initiative helps hundreds of low-income families purchase homes. Our collaboration with our community partners has allowed us to analyze their data for the 212 homes. The community land trust (CLT) allows homeownership to be more affordable to buyers by separating ownership of the land and the home. The organization owns the land, while homeowners purchase the house at a reduced price. USA Homes also supports homeowners, reducing foreclosure risks and stabilizing neighborhoods against displacement.
             By using Zillow and the town property assessor to obtain the estimated values of the homes that have been sold, we can share knowledge and data with our community partners to help them better understand how the erratic economy has impacted their homes. Each sale also indicates two to four different homeowners, and the data will show how the value of each home has negatively or positively impacted the organization. It is essential to compare the prices and dates of sales of the USA homes to national data to see how trends in the Greater Hartford area coincide.
  Our analysis shows that despite our world's unstable economy, the USA Homes program has provided stability for low-income families in the Greater Hartford area, even as national and local market trends have experienced challenges. We find that while the program reduces some market inequities and improves homeowner stability, it also highlights ongoing struggles tied to home affordability and rapidly increasing prices. These findings can guide future strategies to strengthen our community partners' housing initiatives.

   <h2>Our Question</h2>
  The question is: how has the housing market impacted the USA homes' sale rate and price changes in the suburbs of Hartford? In this heavily fluctuating economy, the stability of a mortgage can be tough for families to maintain. By researching 20 houses in the suburbs of Windsor and Bloomfield, CT, we chose to chart and map 10 from each town that have been sold multiple times, starting from when the organization started in 1995. To conceal the addresses of the homes in Windsor and Bloomfield, we used the letters "B" and "WN", along with a number that represents the index of that number in the list of addresses we were given.

            Figure 1: This visualization displays the price increases in each of the ten properties we chose in Windsor. Each home’s price is represented in three different bars: on the left, the red bar indicates the original price of the given home, on the right, the blue bar indicates the price estimate that Zillow provides, and lastly, in the center the green bar indicates the total change from the price when first sold to the current price estimate Zillow provides. This visualization shows that the ratios of each bar are very similar among all 10 homes, and therefore, the prices in Windsor are all very uniform. While we were unable to figure out a way to show the percent change among every home, the median percent change is over a 350% increase (368.04%), and the average percent change is just over a 500% increase (508.75%).

            Figure 2: 	In a direct contrast to Windsor, the market seems to fluctuate dramatically in Bloomfield, as shown in the ten chosen properties - with some increasing drastically, some increasing minimally, and one (house B10) even decreasing in value. These price ratios are noticeably less uniform - and this is very evident in the case of the house which had a negative price change. In Windsor, the houses typically had a small original price, and a dramatic increase in price leading to the assessed value - and even though the prices were less uniform, this rule still applied. Interestingly, the assessed prices are, for the most part, very similar - just under $300,000. Lastly, in Bloomfield, the median home had a price increase of over 300% (329.41%), and the average home had a price increase of just under 400% (380.26%), which is surprising given the negative change value for B10. The market in Bloomfield appears to fluctuate a lot more than Windsor, and therefore makes it much less predictable.

          <h2>Sources and Methods</h2>

          <p>We chose the houses initially just by those which had the highest and lowest values when first sold, but eventually decided to pivot and choose houses which had been sold the most, and therefore had the most data. In the end, the majority of this extra sale data has not been used fully, as the only values we really used were the first sale price (since CLJ was founded), and assessed value as of 2024 according to Zillow price estimates. The main issue with this data, particularly with the Zillow price estimates, is that it gives the price for a regular buyer - not a buyer who needs support from CLJ to buy a house - therefore, the sale data will always be much less than the price estimate as long as CLJ owns the property. This means the Zillow price estimate is not reliable for CLJ to use, as it does not factor their financial support into the final price. However, given that this is an issue for every single home and not just a few of them, using that data still has some value in showing how the value has increased over time, but it is still important to keep in mind that the Zillow price estimate will be inflated.
